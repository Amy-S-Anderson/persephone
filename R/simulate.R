# PERSEPHONE: Agent-Based Model for Bioarchaeology
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file contains the core simulation engine and its helper functions.
# Individual agents:
#   - Are born as a starting pop of a specified size
#   - Experience a risk of dying in each time step of the model
#   - Age-specific mortality risks follow a Siler function


# Depending on other option arguments, agents may:
#   - Face a stable annual risk of forming a skeletal lesion within a specified age range
#   - Experience different age-specific mortality depending on lesion status
#   - Experience different age-specific risks of traumatic death, and age/lesion-specific risks of illness-related death. 
#   - Be deposited (or not) in a cemetery. 
#   - Be preserved (or not) in the cemetery until time of recovery.
#   - Have their age-at-death estimated from skeletal features (which adds noise and bias to actual ages)






# --- Main simulation function (exported) ---

#' Simulate a cemetery using the Persephone ABM
#'
#' Runs the Persephone agent-based model: a birth pop ages throughcurrent_time,
#' facing annual risks of skeletal lesion formation and Siler-model mortality.
#' Individuals with lesions may experience modified mortality risk. The
#' simulation ends when fewer than 10 individuals remain alive.
#'
#' @param pop0_size Integer. Number of individuals in the starting pop.
#' @param dx Numeric. Size of thecurrent_timestep in which all other model actions are applied.
#' @param max_years. Integer. Number of years to run the simulation, given that the population doesn't crash before then. 
#' @param lesion_formation_rate Numeric. Annual probability of developing a
#'   lesion (between 0 and 1).
#' @param lesion_formation_window  numeric vector of length = 2. c(Age at which lesions can start forming, Age at which lesions stop forming)
#' @param mortality_risk_type Character. How lesions modify mortality:
#'   "proportional", "time_decreasing", or "time_increasing".
#' @param lesion_related_hazard Numeric. Mortality multiplier for individuals
#'   with lesions. 1 = no effect, 2 = double risk. Default 1.
#' @param tfr Numeric. Total fertility rate. 
#' @param mortality_regime Data frame with Siler parameters (a1, b1, a2, a3, b3).
#' @param trauma_regime Data frame with key ages and the proportion of deaths due to traumatic injury at these ages. Defaults to NULL (no competing hazards in the model, just all-cause mortality)
#' @param pop_growth_rate Numeric. The population growth rate
#' @param age_structured Logical. Is the starting population age-structured, or an age cohort?
#' @param deposition_param Numeric. the minimum age for including agents in the cemetery
#' @param taphonomy_regime A named data frame storing Siler values. Taphonomic loss, like mortality hazard, is greatest for infants and elders, so we chose to model it using a Siler function.  
#' @param loss_strength Character. describes age-dependent preservation bias (defaults to 'no_decay')
#' @param age_noise Logical. If TRUE, then age estimation error is added to estimated age-at-death. 
#' @param yearly_updates Logical. If TRUE, then the model prints current year and population size at the end of each time step during the model run. Useful for assessing simulation progress, especially when timeframe, TFR, or population size are large.
